ADT is a simple patient registration application written in Ruby on Rails
and is intended as a web front end for OpenMRS.

AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives of millions. Our mission is 
to foster self-sustaining health information technology implementations in 
these environments through peer mentorship, proactive collaboration, and a code 
base that equals or surpasses proprietary equivalents. You are welcome to come
